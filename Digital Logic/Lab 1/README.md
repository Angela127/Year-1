## ðŸ’­ Reflection
<p align= "justify">
This lab introduced me to the fundamentals of breadboarding and testing various combinational logic circuits. It was a completely new experience for me as I had never worked with the ETS5000 trainer kit before. While the hands-on nature of the lab was exciting, it was also quite challenging, particularly when it came to connecting the wires correctly and ensuring that the circuit functioned as intended.

Through this lab, I gained a deeper understanding of how combinational logic circuits operate and how to implement them practically. It allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, enhancing my technical skills. The process of troubleshooting and testing the circuits helped me develop greater attention to detail and problem-solving abilities, especially when identifying and fixing issues with the connections.

Despite the challenges, I found the experience rewarding as it provided a solid foundation for understanding basic electronic components and their behavior. To make the lab even more effective, having more demonstrations or visual aids could also make the process less intimidating and help students feel more confident in their abilities.

Overall, this lab was an invaluable learning opportunity that not only introduced me to essential tools and techniques in electronics but also strengthened my ability to tackle new and unfamiliar tasks.
