Lab 2 focused on designing combinational digital circuit simulations using the Deeds Simulator. Through this lab, I developed a strong understanding of digital logic circuit design, including creating truth tables and timing diagrams using the Deeds Simulator. The hands-on approach allowed me to grasp the complete cycle of designing a combinational circuit, from conceptualization to simulation.

This lab was particularly valuable as it provided me with practical experience in analyzing and visualizing circuit behavior. I learned how to interpret timing diagrams to understand the circuit's performance and ensure it met the design requirements. Additionally, mastering the process of generating and simulating truth tables enhanced my ability to verify the logical accuracy of circuits effectively. The use of the Deeds Simulator not only streamlined the design process but also offered a clear and interactive way to test and refine my designs. By simulating the circuits, I gained insights into their real-world functionality, which significantly improved my confidence in applying theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.

To enhance the learning experience further, it would be beneficial to include more real-life examples of where combinational circuits are used, such as in arithmetic units or multiplexers. Additionally, providing more complex challenges or open-ended tasks could help deepen our understanding of circuit design and simulation.

Overall, Lab 2 was a highly enriching experience that strengthened my technical skills and prepared me for more advanced topics in digital electronics. It also helped me appreciate the importance of simulation tools in modern circuit design.
