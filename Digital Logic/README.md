## ðŸ’­ Reflection
<p align= "justify">
Digital Logic, a relatively new course for me, has been an eye-opening and enriching learning experience. While the course provided a solid foundation in the fundamentals of digital logic, it also allowed me to explore programmable logic devices (PLDs) through hands-on lab sessions, making it both engaging and practical. In the lab, I had the opportunity to use simulation software, such as Deeds Simulator, to design and test digital circuits virtually. This provided a safe and efficient way to experiment with various configurations and observe their outcomes. However, what made the experience even more exciting was working with real circuits and devices. Handling physical components, such as ICs, breadboards and the ETS-5000 Digital Kit, was a completely new and challenging experience for me. These activities bridged the gap between theory and practice, deepening my understanding of how digital logic functions in real-world applications.

This course not only enhanced my technical knowledge but also strengthened my practical skills. I developed a better grasp of concepts like logic gates, truth tables, sequential circuits and programmable devices. Additionally, working on real hardware taught me the importance of precision, troubleshooting and attention to detail when assembling and testing circuits. Other than that, the collaborative project provided opportunities to work as a team, tackling more complex problems and gaining deeper insights into the subject.

To improve this course further, incorporating more real-world applications of digital logicâ€”such as its role in microcontrollers, automation and embedded systemsâ€”would make the content even more relatable and impactful. 

Overall, Digital Logic has been a highly valuable course, equipping me with both the theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary for my future career. The combination of interactive labs, real-world problem-solving and hands-on practice has been instrumental in building a strong foundation in this critical field of study.
