## ðŸ’­ Reflection
<p align= "justify">
Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of the practical applications of logic gates, medium-scale integration (MSI), flip-flops and shift registers. Additionally, this project has significantly improved my collaborative and communication skills as working closely with my group members was essential to successfully designing and constructing a complete circuit.

We successfully used numerous digital logic principles and MSI circuits to facilitate secure and efficient data transport between two labs. It incorporates components such as multiplexers (MUX), demultiplexers (DEMUX), adders, decoders, encodersï¼Œ comparators and so on, all working together to meet the project's objectives. These components enable critical functionalities, including bidirectional data flow, user authentication through password comparators and destination selection, resulting in a robust and functional system.

Despite its success, the system has some limitations. For instance, due to the overall circuit design, our parity checker is unable to transfer the last bit of data. To address this issue, we plan to implement a maximum or optimized data bit transfer mechanism in future iterations to ensure seamless data transmission.

In conclusion, this project provided valuable insights into digital system design and implementation while highlighting the importance of teamwork and effective communication in achieving complex goals. It also taught us to critically analyze and improve upon system limitations. By overcoming these challenges and refining the design, we aim to further enhance the system's reliability and functionality, ensuring its practical use in real-world applications.
