## ðŸ’­ Reflection
<p align= "justify">
In lab exercise 3, I was tasked with building a C++ program to determine the status of a zone by calculating the number of active COVID-19 cases. This exercise provided an excellent opportunity to enhance my understanding of functions in C++, particularly the differences between returning and non-returning functions.

One of the key aspects of this lab was the use of user-defined functions to gather input from the user and process the data effectively. By implementing these functions, I learned how to modularize the program, making it easier to read, debug and maintain. It also helped me recognize the importance of designing functions with clear purposes, such as those dedicated to returning values or simply performing actions without returning anything.

Furthermore, this exercise reinforced my problem-solving skills as I had to carefully plan the program's structure to ensure accurate calculations and outputs. Understanding how to integrate user-defined functions into the main program flow was a significant takeaway, as it demonstrated how functions can streamline complex tasks.

Overall, lab exercise 3 was a valuable learning experience that deepened my knowledge of function types and their practical applications in real-world scenarios like tracking COVID-19 cases. Moving forward, I aim to apply these concepts to create more efficient and user-friendly programs. I also look forward to exploring advanced techniques for optimizing program performance and improving data handling in future exercises.
