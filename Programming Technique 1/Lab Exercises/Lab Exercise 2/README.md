Unlike Lab Exercise 1, Lab Exercise 2 required to write a C++ program to read an integer, calculate the sum of its digits and determine whether the sum is a multiple of 3, 4 or 5. This task was challenging, particularly in figuring out how to code the program to display the digit-by-digit calculation, such as 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20. However, this exercise provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of looping structures and conditional statements in C++.

To tackle this challenge, I learned how to use loops effectively to extract each digit of the number and accumulate their sum. Additionally, formatting the output to show the calculation process step by step required careful attention to detail, which further improved my problem-solving skills. I also practiced using selection statements to check the divisibility of the sum by 3, 4 and 5, reinforcing my knowledge of conditional logic.

This lab exercise not only strengthened my understanding of loops and selections but also taught me how to manage program flow more efficiently. It was rewarding to see how the proper use of loops and conditions could simplify seemingly complex tasks, making the program both functional and user-friendly.

In conclusion, Lab Exercise 2 was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my programming skills and logical thinking. Moving forward, I aim to apply these concepts to more complex problems, especially those involving mathematical computations and detailed output formatting. I also hope to improve my ability to optimize code for better readability and efficiency in future assignments.
