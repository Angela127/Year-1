In Assignment 2, we were tasked with building a C++ program to calculate a car loan. We were presented with two options: the Proton Loan Calculator and the Perodua Loan Calculator. After a thoughtful discussion among our team, we decided to develop the Perodua Loan Calculator. This assignment was particularly challenging as it required us to determine the correct formula for calculating the loan accurately.

To enhance the efficiency and readability of our code, we utilized user-defined functions to modularize the calculations and make the code more concise. Additionally, we implemented loops and branching to handle user inputs and different scenarios dynamically, which improved the functionality and usability of the program. This structured approach not only helped us manage the complexity of the assignment but also deepened our understanding of C++ programming concepts.

This assignment significantly improved my problem-solving skills as it required me to engage in critical thinking to develop the most effective and accurate solution. Breaking down the problem into smaller parts and analyzing how each component interacts with the others helped me better understand the importance of logical flow in programming.

Moreover, this project greatly enhanced my collaboration skills. Working closely with my teammates, we discussed various approaches to ensure our solution was accurate and efficient. The collaborative process involved open communication, brainstorming and collectively addressing any challenges we faced during development. This teamwork not only made the assignment more manageable but also fostered a sense of shared responsibility and achievement.

In conclusion, this assignment was a valuable learning experience that provided hands-on exposure to applying programming concepts in real-world scenarios. It taught me the importance of breaking down complex problems, working collaboratively and using structured coding techniques like user-defined functions and loops to optimize solutions. Moving forward, I hope future assignments can include more diverse real-world scenarios as they would further prepare us for challenges in professional environments.
