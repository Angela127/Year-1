<p align="justify">
Programming techniques involve structured approaches to problem-solving by designing and implementing efficient algorithms and solutions. This subject introduces core concepts and practices in programming, with a focus on the C++ language. It covers essential topics such as data types, control structures (like loops and conditionals), functions, arrays, file handling, pointers, and structured data types. By learning these techniques, we can develop the ability to write and debug programs, tackling problems ranging from simple to moderately complex, all while gaining a strong foundation in computational thinking.

In the Programming Technique 1 course, I was introduced to fundamental programming concepts, including pseudocode, flowcharts and the C++ programming language, all of which were new to me at the start. This course provided me with a strong foundation in algorithmic operations, functions, arrays, input and output handling, pointers, and structured data. These topics represent the building blocks of programming and are essential for developing problem-solving skills.

One of the key takeaways from this course was understanding how these fundamentals serve as a foundation for more advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in future semester. By learning how to design algorithms and implement them using C++, I developed a clearer understanding of how to approach and solve programming challenges systematically. Additionally, the exposure to C++ programming has practical significance for my future career. C++ is widely used in backend development and is valued for its efficiency and versatility. This knowledge will not only help me in building robust systems but also provide a pathway to exploring more complex programming paradigms and technologies. This course also highlighted the importance of logical thinking and code organization. For example, creating flowcharts and writing pseudocode taught me to plan before coding, which is a crucial skill for tackling larger and more complex projects. Understanding pointers and structured data, though initially challenging, gave me insights into how memory management and data organization are handled in programming.

Overall, Programming Technique 1 has been an invaluable experience that has equipped me with foundational skills for both academic and professional growth. Moving forward, I aim to build upon these concepts by exploring more advanced programming techniques and applying them to real-world projects. I hope that the course can include more interactive learning namely incorporating more interactive activities, such as live coding sessions, group discussions or coding challenges. Platforms like Kahoot or online coding games can make the learning process more engaging and interesting rather than just giving lab exercises and assignments.
