<p align="justify">
Programming techniques involve structured approaches to problem-solving by designing and implementing efficient algorithms and solutions. This subject introduces core concepts and practices in programming, with a focus on the C++ language. It covers essential topics such as data types, control structures (like loops and conditionals), functions, arrays, file handling, pointers, and structured data types. By learning these techniques, we can develop the ability to write and debug programs, tackling problems ranging from simple to moderately complex, all while gaining a strong foundation in computational thinking.
