This lab exercise required me to create a flowchart and pseudocode that can read an integer, calculate the sum of its digits and determine whether the number is odd or even and multiple of 4 and 5. Initially, I found this task quite challenging as it required understanding how to use division and modulus operators effectively to extract and process the digits of an integer. Through this exercise, I gained a deeper understanding of the logical steps involved in breaking down a number into its individual digits. The use of the modulus operator to isolate digits and the division operator to reduce the number was particularly insightful and significantly improved my ability to handle such problems in programming.

In addition to enhancing my programming logic, this task also helped me better understand the structure and components of a flowchart. I now have a clearer grasp of the role of each symbol, such as the Start and End symbols, process blocks, decision diamonds, et cetera and how they work together to represent the flow of a program. Designing the flowchart required me to think critically about the sequence of operations and the overall structure of the solution, which in turn improved my problem-solving and analytical skills. Furthermore, writing the pseudocode provided valuable practice in translating logical ideas into a structured, step-by-step representation. This reinforced my understanding of the logic behind the solution and how it can be implemented in actual programming.

In conclusion, this lab exercise was an excellent opportunity to strengthen my foundational skills in both algorithm design and programming logic. Moving forward, I hope to work on more exercises that involve real-world scenarios as they will further improve my ability to apply these concepts practically. I also look forward to exploring how such basic mathematical operations can be integrated into larger, more complex programs.
