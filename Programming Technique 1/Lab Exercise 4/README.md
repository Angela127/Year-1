## ðŸ’­ Reflection
<p align= "justify">

In Lab Exercise 4, I was tasked with creating a program to read temperature data in Celsius from a text file, convert them to Fahrenheit and then output the results to another text file. This exercise introduced a new level of complexity as it required the use of user-defined functions to handle file input and output operations while processing the data in an array format. One of the main challenges I faced was the lack of prior information in the teaching slides about reading text files within user-defined functions. This gap pushed me to conduct independent research and experimentation to understand how to implement file handling in functions. Through trial and error, I learned how to open, read and write files in C++ while ensuring the program worked efficiently with arrays.

This exercise also helped me strengthen my understanding of file I/O operations and array manipulation. By breaking the task into smaller steps such as reading data into an array, performing the conversion and writing the results to a new file, I developed better problem-solving and debugging skills. Additionally, this lab exercise highlighted the value of user-defined functions in organizing code, making it modular and easier to maintain. I now appreciate how functions can simplify complex tasks by encapsulating specific operations such as file handling or data conversion, into reusable components.

Overall, Lab Exercise 4 was both challenging and rewarding as it allowed me to explore new concepts beyond the lecture material and apply them to a practical problem. Moving forward, I hope future exercises will include more detailed examples of advanced file handling and data processing to support deeper learning and confidence in applying these techniques.
