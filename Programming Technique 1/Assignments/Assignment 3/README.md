## ðŸ’­ Reflection
<p align= "justify">
For this assignment, we were tasked with building a C++ program to generate a report on the number of student intakes, enrolments and outputs in public universities. Unlike Assignment 2, this assignment introduced new challenges as we had to read input data from a file and write the processed output to another file. This experience enhanced my understanding of file handling in C++ and how to manage structured data effectively.

To tackle this assignment, we utilized structured data types to organize and process the information more efficiently. Arrays were used to store the data, while loops and branching were implemented to analyze it. For example, we wrote code to identify the indices with the highest and lowest values in the dataset, which required careful planning and attention to detail. By using these techniques, we were able to create a concise and efficient program that met all the requirements.

This assignment significantly improved my problem-solving skills as I needed to think critically and logically about how to design and implement a program that could handle data input, processing and output seamlessly. Working with file operations and structured data also deepened my understanding of data management which is an essential skill in programming.

Additionally, the project strengthened my collaboration skills. Collaborating with my teammates required effective communication and teamwork to divide tasks, share ideas and troubleshoot issues together. This not only made the assignment more manageable but also provided a valuable opportunity to learn from one another and build a strong team dynamic.

In conclusion, this assignment was a valuable learning experience that taught me the importance of file handling, structured data and efficient coding practices. It also highlighted the value of collaboration and teamwork in solving complex problems. Moving forward, I hope future assignments will include even more diverse applications of programming such as handling real-world datasets or integrating additional functionalities to further enhance our technical and analytical skills.
