## üí≠ Reflection
<p align= "justify">
Through the assignments given in this course, I have gained a profound understanding of the causes and effects of corruption, not only on individuals but also on society as a whole. By exploring various forms of corruption, I discovered that misuse of power occurs more frequently in daily life than I previously realized. Additionally, I learned effective strategies to prevent corruption, such as reporting suspicious activities to the appropriate authorities. This ensures that those involved are held accountable and face appropriate consequences, such as penalties or imprisonment.

Moreover, completing these assignments enhanced my collaboration skills. Working closely with my teammates, I learned the importance of teamwork, effective communication, and mutual support to successfully achieve our project goals. This experience emphasized that combating corruption requires collective effort and shared responsibility.

The course has also inspired me to adopt the motto ‚ÄúSay NO to corruption‚Äù as a guiding principle in my life. It serves as a constant reminder to uphold integrity and promote ethical behavior in both personal and professional settings.

In conclusion, while the current activities in the course, such as creating posters and videos, were educational, I believe adding more interactive and hands-on activities would make the learning experience even more impactful. For example, organizing debates, role-playing scenarios, or hosting guest speakers from anti-corruption organizations could help students gain a deeper understanding of the importance of preventing corruption. These additions would further prepare us to take active roles in promoting integrity and combating corruption in our communities.
