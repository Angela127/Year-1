## ðŸ’­ Reflection
<p align= "justify">
In this course, I have gained extensive knowledge about the fundamentals of information systems and technology, covering not only hardware and software but also networks and communication technologies. These insights have been instrumental in preparing me for my future career in the field of computer science. Additionally, I have learned practical skills such as PC installation, which involved assembling and disassembling the Central Processing Unit (CPU). This hands-on experience provided me with valuable insights into the complexities of computer hardware, enhancing my technical proficiency.

Moreover, participating in industry talks and industry visits enriched my learning journey. The industry talks offered valuable insights into the transformative role of ICT professionals in driving advancements in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and extended reality (XR). These discussions highlighted the vast potential and opportunities within the technology landscape and motivated me to strive for excellence in these cutting-edge fields. On the other hand, industry visits, such as those to UTM Digital and Petronas, provided me with a closer look at cutting-edge technologies like Newline Technology and facial recognition systems. These visits also gave me a clearer understanding of the key skills required in computer science, including analytical thinking, problem-solving, productivity, and programming expertise. Witnessing these technologies in action reinforced the importance of building a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. Furthermore, gaining hands-on experience with tools like Git and frameworks like Laravel is vital for aligning with industry expectations. I also aim to strengthen my understanding of security protocols, SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) methodologies, and project management techniques to better meet professional standards.

Engaging in the Design Thinking Project allowed me to delve deeper into the world of the Internet of Things (IoT). This experience not only broadened my understanding of emerging technologies but also encouraged me to think creatively and improve my problem-solving skills by exploring practical solutions to real-world challenges. Through these projects, I also managed to improve my collaboration skills by cooperate well with my teammates and also communication skills during presentation.

In conclusion, while the industry talks provided valuable theoretical knowledge, I believe incorporating more industry visits in the future would offer even greater benefits. Real-life exposure to cutting-edge technologies and professional environments would inspire resilience, enhance our practical understanding, and better prepare us to contribute meaningfully to society. Such experiences would not only motivate us to excel in our careers but also enable us to make impactful contributions to the field of computer science and beyond.
