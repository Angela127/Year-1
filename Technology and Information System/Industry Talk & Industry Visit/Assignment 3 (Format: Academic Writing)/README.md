The insights shared by Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmall and Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah, as well as the research findings on industry-required skills, highlight the critical importance of aligning academic learning with real-world demands in the field of computer science and IT. Their experiences and advice have deepened my understanding of the technical and interpersonal skills necessary for career success in this dynamic and evolving industry.

Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmall‚Äôs professional journey is an inspiring example of how passion and resilience can drive innovation in technology. I particularly admire his ability to manage high-priority tasks within tight deadlines, which reflects his dedication and strong problem-solving skills. His experiences emphasize the importance of embracing challenges, learning from mistakes and collaborating effectively with teams. Similarly, Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah‚Äôs focus on preparing students for internships through the IRPA (Identify, Research, Prepare, Apply) method is both practical and insightful. The step-by-step process of identifying personal goals, researching companies, preparing ATS-compliant CVs and applying strategically is an actionable guide for navigating the job application process. Additionally, his entrepreneurial endeavors, such as co-founding platforms like GetMeHired.io, highlight the potential of leveraging technology to address real-world needs, which is both motivating and instructive.

As a computer science student, these insights have encouraged me to reflect on my own skills and aspirations. I recognize the importance of building a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, while also gaining hands-on experience with tools like Git and frameworks such as Laravel. Additionally, I aim to strengthen my understanding of security protocols, SDLC methodologies and project management techniques to align with industry expectations. Equally important is the development of my interpersonal skills. Engaging in group projects, participating in extracurricular activities and seeking leadership opportunities will help me grow as a team player and a leader. I am also inspired to take advantage of platforms like LinkedIn and Jobstreet to explore internship opportunities, leveraging the guidance provided by Mr. Nik.

In conclusion, the sessions and research findings have provided valuable perspectives on how to bridge the gap between academic preparation and industry demands. Over the next four years, I plan to strengthen my expertise in data management and system development. This includes dedicating myself to mastering widely-used programming languages and gaining hands-on experience through practical, real-world projects. My goal is not only to retain theoretical knowledge but to develop a deep understanding that will enable me to make meaningful contributions in diverse career opportunities. Additionally, I aim to enhance my soft skills by actively engaging in various activities to align myself with the competencies sought after by employers.
