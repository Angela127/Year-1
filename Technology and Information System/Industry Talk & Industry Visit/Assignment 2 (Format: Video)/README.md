The visit to UTM Digital offered me a profound and enlightening experience, showcasing the remarkable technological advancements and digital solutions implemented at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. During the session, I gained valuable insights into the services provided by UTM Digital, including UTMID, official email platforms, and university websites, as well as the campus-wide WiFi coverage. The announcement about the implementation of WiFi 6 next year to enhance connectivity was particularly exciting, reflecting the university's proactive approach to technological upgrades.

We also visited the Sangfor Room, where I explored the functionality of Newline technology. This advanced tool not only supports access to numerous applications but also includes features like Newline Cast and Newline Broadcast, allowing seamless screen sharing and broadcasting to other devices. Following this, we toured the Open Office, which houses several departments. I was intrigued to learn that many of UTM's websites are developed using PHP language and how essential tools like Power BI are for data visualization‚Äîan area critical to my field as a data engineering student. The visit concluded at the Digital Care & Multipurpose center, where technical issues on campus are addressed, emphasizing the comprehensive support system available to students and staff.

In summary, the cutting-edge technologies observed at UTM Digital highlighted the university's commitment to staying at the forefront of innovation. This experience underscored the importance of continuous learning and adapting to technological advancements to stay relevant in today's fast-paced world. Although I made some recommendations regarding video editing and content selection, I wasn‚Äôt directly involved in the editing process. Looking ahead, I aim to improve my skills in video editing and content creation by actively participating in the creative projects such as video editing in future opportunities, enabling me to contribute more effectively to multimedia projects.
