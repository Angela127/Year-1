During the industry visit, attending the talk Who, Why, What, How? Software Engineering by Mr Roman Kvaska from Petronas Digital Sdn Bhd was an enlightening experience that broadened my understanding of the dynamic field of software engineering. The session provided me with valuable insights into the fundamentals of software development and its critical role in driving innovation and solving real-world problems. Mr Roman's emphasis on the skills required for success in software engineering resonated with me. Analytical thinking, problem-solving and programming skills stood out as foundational abilities while productivity and an understanding of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) were highlighted as essential for efficient project execution. His insights into the importance of lifelong learning have motivated me to continuously enhance my knowledge and skills to stay relevant in this rapidly evolving industry.
  
This talk has not only expanded my technical knowledge but also emphasized the importance of adaptability, teamwork and a proactive attitude in achieving success in the software engineering domain. The innovative projects at Petronas, such as face recognition and automatic detection systems, have further inspired me to explore how software engineering can contribute to solving complex problems and advancing technology.

In conclusion, this session has been an invaluable learning experience that has deepened my appreciation for computer science in software engineering and its vast potential. It has motivated me to actively pursue opportunities to develop my skills and embrace the challenges of this dynamic field. I am grateful for the opportunity to gain these insights and am excited about the journey ahead in computer science.
