## Course Information ðŸ”¢

<p align="justify">
Discrete structure refer to the mathematical concepts and techniques used to study and analyze discrete objects rather than continuous ones. In computer science, it includes topics like set theory, logic, relations, functions, graph theory, and finite automata. These concepts form the foundation for algorithms, data structures, and theoretical computing. By the end of the course, we will be able to use these concepts to solve computer science problems, analyze challenges with recurrence and counting, apply graph theory and tree structures to real-world problems, and model devices using deterministic finite state machines.
