## Course Information ðŸ”¢

<p align="justify">
Discrete structure refer to the mathematical concepts and techniques used to study and analyze discrete objects rather than continuous ones. In computer science, it includes topics like set theory, logic, relations, functions, graph theory, and finite automata. These concepts form the foundation for algorithms, data structures, and theoretical computing. By the end of the course, we will be able to use these concepts to solve computer science problems, analyze challenges with recurrence and counting, apply graph theory and tree structures to real-world problems and model devices using deterministic finite state machines.

**Module 2** - Relations and Functions <br>
**Module 3** - Counting Methods and Probability <br>
**Module 4** - Graph Theory <br>
**Module 5** - Finite Automata <br>

## ðŸ’­ Reflection
<p align= "justify">
Through this course, I have explored a wide range of mathematical concepts, including set theory, logic, relations, functions, graph theory and finite automata. These topics have not only enhanced my understanding of discrete mathematics but also equipped me with the tools to tackle real-world problems effectively. By applying these concepts in assignments and exercises, I have significantly improved my problem-solving skills, particularly in identifying logical structures and designing efficient solutions. In addition to the technical knowledge, the group assignments provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen my collaboration skills. Working in a team required effective communication, mutual respect and shared responsibility, which are essential skills for academic and professional success. These experiences taught me how to leverage diverse perspectives and build consensus to achieve common goals.

While the course has been highly educational, I believe incorporating more interactive activities during lectures could make the learning process even more engaging. For example, incorporating real-time problem-solving challenges, interactive quizzes or collaborative brainstorming sessions could foster a more dynamic and participatory environment. This would not only make the lectures more interesting but also deepen our understanding of the concepts through hands-on application.

In conclusion, this course has provided me with a strong foundation in discrete mathematics, improving both my analytical and collaborative abilities. The knowledge and skills I have gained will undoubtedly benefit me in future courses and in solving complex problems in my career.
