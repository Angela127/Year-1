In Assignment 2, we were tasked with solving problems related to permutation, combination and the Pigeonhole Principle. The sections on permutation and combination enhanced my understanding of counting principles and how to arrange or select items in specific scenarios. These problems required me to apply formulas systematically and think critically to determine whether the order of items mattered or not, which is a key distinction between permutations and combinations.

However, the Pigeonhole Principle presented a much greater challenge. This concept required us to carefully identify both the "pigeons" (items to be distributed) and the "pigeonholes" (categories or groups into which items are distributed). Any misunderstanding in defining these elements could lead to errors in the entire solution. Working through these problems significantly improved my analytical and logical reasoning skills as I had to interpret the problem statement accurately and apply the principle effectively to arrive at correct conclusions.

This assignment not only strengthened my mathematical problem-solving abilities but also improved my attention to detail and precision in tackling complex questions. The process of breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts and systematically solving them has been highly beneficial.
