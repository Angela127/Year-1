Assignment 3 focused on several critical topics in discrete mathematics, including discrete probabilities, graph theory, shortest path problems, trees, and Dijkstra's Algorithm. Among these topics, I found discrete probabilities, particularly Bayes' Theorem, to be quite challenging. This theorem requires careful identification of the given events and their conditional relationships. Misinterpreting these conditions can lead to incorrect calculations so it was crucial to read the problem statement thoroughly and break down the given data systematically. Working through these problems improved my analytical thinking and attention to detail as I had to clearly define each event and apply the theorem logically.

The sections on graph theory and the shortest path problem were equally intriguing. I learned about the different types of graphs, such as directed and undirected graphs and how they are used to model relationships and networks. The tree structures section was particularly fascinating, as it provided insight into hierarchical data organization. Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs was a practical and rewarding experience. This part of the assignment deepened my understanding of algorithmic design and its importance in solving optimization problems efficiently.
